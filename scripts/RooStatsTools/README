This is a repository of common statistical scripts specific 
to the ATLAS statistical recommendations.  The scripts might be updated, which
is why we are using SVN to keep track of versioning.

Several scripts need ROOT 5.30 or greater to run.

To use the scripts, you can either download them from the web page or 
   svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/atlasgrp/Physics/StatForum/RooStatsTools/

More information on the recommendations can be found here:
   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/StatisticsTools
   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/FrequentistLimitRecommendationImplementation
   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/BayesianLimitRecommendationImplementation

In addition, there are standard scripts in the ROOT release tutorials directory.  See:
   $ROOTSYS/tutorials/roostats/
or
   http://root.cern.ch/root/html/tutorials/roostats/index.html
The could be copied here, but that might lead to version control issues.

In particular, you are encouraged to use the diagnostic tools:
   StandardTestStatDistributionDemo.C 
   StandardProfileInspectorDemo.C

For support, you are encouraged to write:
   <atlas-phys-stat-root@cern.ch> 
for ATLAS specific questions (particularly with ATLAS-sensitive information).
For more technial RooFit/RooStats issues, you can write:
   <roostats-development@cern.ch>
For more general statistical questions, you can write:
   <hn-atlas-physics-statistics@cern.ch>
